# personal_site
Today I have worked on my Fullstack assignment to enchance my capabilites with CSS, HTML, JS, and Github. During the process I was required to make at least two commits to the "main" branch, along with descriptve comments on all commits. Our class was required to have at least three functional pages that could futher detail ourself. I believe I have succecfully made the  requirements in order to pass the first assesment. If anything is to be edited I will complete the necessary process in github, terminal, and vsCode. The porftfolio shows a HOME page and about me page along with a portfolio. Lorem Epsum was used to fill in the blaks.
